# THIS BATCH PROCESS IS TO START ZOOKEEPER AND KAFKA RESPECTIVELY. 

# YOU MAY NEED TO CHANGE THE CONFIG FILE NAMES IF THEY DO NOT MATCH YOUR FILENAME(S)

# ADD A NEW 'start cmd /k "cd %klocation% && .\bin\windows\kafka-server-start.bat .\config\server.properties"' 
	LINE FOR EACH ADDITIONAL BROKER YOU HAVE (CHANGE THE CONFIG FILE NAME ACCORDINGLY).

# YOU WILL BE PROMPTED TO HIT ENTER ONCE ZOOKEEPER HAS STARTED UP
